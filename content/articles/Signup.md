### Here's why you should consider subscribing:
Maybe the challenges here below don't apply to you, but the three biggest problems I hear about over and over again, are:  
- "I keep getting ghosted"
- "I'm just not good at selling - I keep losing deals"
- "It's hard to get paid what my coaching or consulting is worth"

And if that's you, know that you're not alone:

From solo-traders and founders, all the way through to professional sales teams at corporations:

Everyone wishes they could get more sales out of all their pipeline efforts.

There's many ways to get better at selling, from training to coaching and outright practice.

But, don't try anything, until you've assessed, and resolved to improve, the most important determining factor in closing more sales: the consistency of your habits. 

<br />
### If you want more sales, you need to improve your pipeline performance habits
Because whether it's sports, playing the piano or selling:

If you don't have healthy, constructive and reinforcing performance habits for that outcome you're looking to achieve, you'll struggle get results. 

**The SFC Pipeline Habit Scorecard is a simple but very powerful tool for assessing which specific habits need improving, in order for you to get more sales out of your pipeline.**

Get the scorecard today, and get yourself an honest assessment on the make-or-break behaviours that you need to have in place, for your deals to move forward and your sales to close.
