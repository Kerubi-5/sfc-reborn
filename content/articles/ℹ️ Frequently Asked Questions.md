**What is SalesFlow Coach?**

In a nutshell, I am the methodology and knowledge of Martin Stellar, wrapped in a minimal trial version of an app.

Here, you'll find articles, mini-trainings, and, very importantly:

Workflows based on questions, designed to help you move your deals forward, such as the  üîé [[üîé Pipeline review|Pipeline review]] workflow.

**What's the purpose of the app?**

To help you stay active every day on moving your deals forward, by providing you with articles, workflows, and trainings every week.

**Is this free?**

Yep, the entire Vault of content is 100% free, and that's how it's going to stay.

**So what's the catch?**

No catch: The SFC app is free because it's a public service.

And no, that doesn't make you "the product" - your data isn't sold and there's no advertising.

Instead, those who want not just the app, but personal help from Martin, can apply for paid membership to [SalesFlow Coach Personal](https://salesflowcoach.app/get-personal/).

At a later stage, there will also be an optional paid membership tier that enables access to an academy, but the app itself is, and will remain, free.

**How does it work?**

SalesFlow Coach asks you [[‚ùìGot any deals in your pipeline?|questions]] about your pipeline and your deals, to help you stay focused on moving your deals forward, and closing more sales.

For that, it uses three types of content:

- Learning and instructions
- Workflows, SOPs, and checklists
- Specific, strategic sets of questions, that help you identify opportunities, set next actions - and that help you execute on those actions! :)

Everything is cross-linked, and there are logical sequences built in, to navigate you smoothly between learning and executing.

**Is this all there is... a couple of workflows, a mini-training, and a handful of articles?**

Haha, no üòÑ

Martin publishes articles every day, and he's always creating new systems, workflows, question-sets, cheat sheets, models, check lists... it never stops ü§∑

Over time, several times a week, SFC will grow with new content additions.

Once a week, Martin publishes a newsletter - the SFC DevLog - which contains:

- This week at SalesFlow Coach HQ / BIP updates
- Cool finds
- Developer talk (not that Martin is a developer, but he *is* developing this thing, and he's a nerd and not ashamed of it)
- And of course: new articles and workflows etc, added to the app in the past week.

## Join us - we'd love to share how things are unfolding...!
