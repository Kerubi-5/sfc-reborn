> [[🔁 Workflows]] >> [[⛏️ MYNO = Mine Your Network for Opportunities|Mine Your Network for Opportunities]] >> What size opportunity might this be?

Remember, we're not just looking for clients here:

We're looking for _opportunities_, and those exist in all kinds of forms.

And, they exist in all kinds of size.

So whatever the type of opportunity, ask yourself what size it might be.

- For buyers: what dollar amount?

- For referrers: how high is the quality of their network?

- For allies: how active would they be in collaborating with you?

- For partners: how much business, or finder's fees, could they bring you?

- For podcasters: what size is their audience?

- For professional associations: How advanced are their members? How pro-active is the organisation in promoting people such as yourself?

One by one, rank each name in Column B, where 1 is a large opportunity, and 5 is a small one.

Next up, we need to ask ourselves:
