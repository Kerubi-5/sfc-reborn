title: ❓ What actually defines a contact as someone who might hold an opportunity for you?

> [[🔁 Workflows]] >> [[⛏️ MYNO = Mine Your Network for Opportunities|Mine Your Network for Opportunities]] >> Two simple criteria for listing names

We're looking for people who meet two criteria:

1: They understand the work you do

2: They would be happy to hear from you

That's all, that's it.

Again: we're not only looking for buyers.

Instead, we're looking for people who: don't need any explanation of what our work is about, and who would welcome hearing from you.

In the next few steps, we'll be sorting through the list, to see who to reach out to first - and how.

So for now, just list every name you find who meets the criteria "gets me" and "likes me".

Next up: **🤔 [[🤔 Let's ask ourselves some questions about these people|Let's ask ourselves some questions about these people]].**
