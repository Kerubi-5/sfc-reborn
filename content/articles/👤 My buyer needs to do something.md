What is it that your buyer needs to do, in order for this deal to advance or close?

"I need my buyer to ....."

Of  course you're not your buyer's boss - you can't order them around.

However, very often a deal stalls for no good reason, simply because of some action that's needed from their side - and very often a simple request or reminder does the job.

So make a note of the action you need to request from your buyer, and [[📆 Schedule action|schedule]] making that request in your calendar or todo app.

Done?
