title: 👨‍🎓 How to use SalesFlow Coach
---

Each day, as early in the day as you can, dive into one of the following areas in your business:

**Take some time to reflect: [[❓ How is your business doing?|How is your business doing?]]**

**Goals on track: [[❓ How is your money game...?|How is your Money Game?]]**

**Work on your sales: [[❓Got any deals in your pipeline?|Any deals in the pipeline?]]**

<br />

## Why does SFC work?

The power of SalesFlow Coach is in [[👨‍🎓 How to handle your sales activities|segmenting different types of activity]], and batching them.

This way, you get to be as efficient and focused as possible, and you remove one of the biggest obstacles to handling and advancing a pipeline: context switching.

So first you review a lead, then you schedule an activity, and you review another lead.

Only once you're done reviewing, do you move into the next activity block: messaging and outreach and followup.

So you batch activities by context, and that will make the entire pipeline process much easier, more fun, and more effective.

Note: while I'm still in Pilot mode, SalesFlow Coach uses the words "leads", "deals", "prospects" etc interchangeably.

I'll evolve over time, but my basic power has already been built:

**[[❓Got any deals in your pipeline?|Advancing deals through your pipeline.]]**
