title: 👬 How tight is your relationship with this person?
---

> [[🔁 Workflows]] >> [[⛏️ MYNO = Mine Your Network for Opportunities|Mine Your Network for Opportunities]] >> What level of proximity exists between you two?

Column D ranks your affinity, proximity, or the tightness of the relationship you have with this person.

That doesn't mean we're asking if you're friends with them, but:

- Are you on a first-name basis?

- Have you shared drinks, personal stories or secrets?

- Could you dial their mobile phone without causing offence?

- Have you only contacted them through their Personal Assistant so far?

- Have you done business before?

- Do you have a lot of overlap in terms of mission or values?

<br />

Score 1 for "best buddies" and 5 for "they don't know I exist".

Moving on, we need to make sure they know the right people:
