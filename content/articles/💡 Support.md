## Need any help?

As a simple humble web app, I can only do so much - but my creator [Martin Stellar](https://martinstellar.com/) is only one click away, and I've heard say that he's a friendly and helpful guy.

And because I'm still in private-beta mode, he would be enormously grateful to hear your feedback.

He'll even help you with your deals, if you send him a friendly, short help request.

Yours,

SalesFlow Coach
