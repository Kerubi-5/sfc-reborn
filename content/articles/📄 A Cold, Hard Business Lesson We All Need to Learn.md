It doesn't matter how good your service is, or how much of an ace team you have or how fantastic your solution is:

In business, it's never about you.

No matter how much you need the money and no matter how awesome this client would be.

No matter how passionate you are about your work and what it does, no matter how impressive your client portfolio or even the results you've gotten for people.

None of that is relevant, because all of that is about you, and business isn't about you.

If you want a healthy business, and you want your buyers to sign up, it‚Äôs always, only and exclusively, about them:

Your buyer, and whether or not their life gets better by buying.

This attitude creates trust - a requirement for sales.

And if you can also step away from the sale, be 100% ok with it if they don‚Äôt buy, you build even more trust.

You need to be unattached to the outcome, and you can‚Äôt fake that. (Also see: [[üìÑ Every business is a relationship business]])

The only way you can create that level of trust is if you genuinely, really, have ‚Äúthe right decision for them‚Äù as your first and foremost interest.

The right choice, for them, at this moment. Help your buyer get there, and even tell them that that is what you're trying to do:

"I've got a solution that I think will work, but I want to make sure you make the best choice, for you, at this moment, even if that's not buying from me. How can I help?"
