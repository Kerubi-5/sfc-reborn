To follow on from the idea of â€˜[[ðŸ“„ Are you selling them a problem? (Pt. 1 - Interaction tax)|selling people a problem]]â€™ - i.e. when the buyer perceives a complication or cost that goes along with your solution - today let's look at interaction-tax.

And while itâ€™s a word I made up, almost all of us force others to pay that tax.

- [[ðŸ“„ Keep your messaging short|An email thatâ€™s long]], and carelessly worded?

Now your buyer needs to allocate mental resources to even grasp the core of your message: you're making them pay interaction-tax.

- A Zoom call with a buyer, where you let them ramble and you donâ€™t guide the conversation to a result of some sort?

They just spent an hour with you, and no real advance was made: Interaction tax.

- Need to tell an employee that youâ€™d like to see them take more responsibility - but you cloak it in a ranting complaint about company morale?

Interaction tax.

- Present a demo[[ðŸ“„ Are you selling them a problem? (Pt. 1 - Interaction tax)#^a47a48]] with logic gaps, and your listener needs to think to connect the dots? Interaction tax.

In so many ways, so very often, we force people to pay a cost to interacting with us, and it goes directly against results, and against everybodyâ€™s interests.

My favourite pet-peeve in this context?

Those blighted audio messages people are always sending each other on Whatsapp. Horrible things.

Ok, so you canâ€™t be bothered to think out, and type up, a pithy, 1-sentence message?

Well, now the recipient needs to spend 90 seconds listening to you rambling and thinking into a microphone, about something that could have been said in 5 seconds, and read in 3 seconds. Your recipient pays interaction tax.

Of course itâ€™s not your intention - but itâ€™s crazily easy to levy interaction tax on others, and we all do it, all the time. 

So be careful to avoid it, especially when youâ€™re dealing with a buyer.

[[ðŸ“„ The worst question, that nearly every seller asks - and what to ask instead|Any interaction they have with you]], be it written feedback on something, or an email or text reply, or a work meeting or coaching session:

Carefully tailor your interaction and messaging to be as friction-free and low-cost as possible for the other. 

Keep the cost to interacting with you low and frictionless, and youâ€™ll magically start seeing things move more smoothly with everyone - including your buyers.
