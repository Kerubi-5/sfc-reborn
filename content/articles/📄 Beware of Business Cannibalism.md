It’s such a tricky trap, so easy to fall into:

Doing the work that supports your business, while postponing the work that grows it.

Your site, your social media updates, organising your files, emptying your inbox…

While all those things are helpful, or useful, or even necessary, they should never be allowed to cannibalise the time you could spend on the activities that drive growth.

But this trap - business cannibalism - is exactly what causes the majority of struggles in business.

If your goal is ‘x number of clients’, then it’s good to ask, when planning activities for your day:

Does this activity directly contribute to reaching my goal?

If the answer is no, then that activity is the last thing you should schedule.

Think of it like this: if you fill a jar with sand, you can’t get the pebbles in. Instead, you first fill it with pebbles, and then you add sand to fill the empty spaces.

The pebbles are the growth-driving activities, and the sand are the things that keep the place running.

If you fill your days with business maintenance, you’ll have no time left for business-growth.
