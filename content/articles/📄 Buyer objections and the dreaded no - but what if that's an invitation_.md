Overheard this a while ago:

 “When a buyer tells me no, or that they don’t have time to talk about my offer, I’m not really sure what to do. Usually, I default to trying again, push a little harder, try a different angle”.

Right. But then you're acting as if you know what's best for them, you're effectively [[📄 How to Make a Buyer Wrong, and Lose the Sale|making them wrong]], and you're guaranteed to trigger psychological reactance. You push back on their pushback, and you'll get pushback in exchange, and you'll be going nowhere real fast.

If a buyer objects, at whatever stage and for whatever reason, there’s some sort of fear going on, somewhere on a deeper psychological level.

## It’s the buyer's lizard brain signalling danger

And if you then press on, you’re only confirming to the lizard brain that it’s correct in warning the buyer of some sort of risk (even if it mistaken), and objections and resistance increase.

Other people take a different stance, when a buyer says no:

“When they tell me no, I just consider it a lost sale and I move on”.

Sure, but that helps nobody. Your buyer doesn't get the help and solutions you can so very adequately provide, and you don't get the sale.

So what about a middle way?

What if someone’s objection or refusal isn’t a rejection, or the end of the conversation, or something you push against - but instead you treat it like it’s an invitation?

What if you use the no as a starting point for a different line of conversation?

What if the no is an invitation for you... to ask a question?

After all, a no means there’s something going on that prevents the yes - so why not try and figure out what that thing is?

Like so:

Buyer says “No”.

You: “Excellent, thanks for telling me”.

You now know where they stand, and you’ve honoured their stance graciously.

Next, you ask a question. For example:

Can you tell me in what way the offer doesn’t meet your needs?”

Or: “Quick question: What would make it a yes?”

“Shall I follow up with you at a later date, when you have more time?”

“Is there anything else I can help you with?”

“Would you like me to point at some resources that might help you solve XYZ? There’s a few books I know that might be useful to you”.

And if none of these seem appropriate, why not ask for an introduction?

“Anyone come to mind who might be open to a conversation?”

See, the no can never be met with force or better argumentation.

It’s not nice, and not effective - not unless you’re a pushy seller, and who wants to live in the 80’s anyway?

The no doesn't have to be the end of a conversation, not if you keep the conversation open.

And you do that by welcoming your buyer's no, and by then asking questions that are relevant and helpful.
