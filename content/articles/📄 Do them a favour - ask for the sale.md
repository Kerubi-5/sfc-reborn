How do you feel, when the time comes to ask for the sale?

Most people feel all kinds of tense and conflicted.

They don't know how to ask, or they're afraid that they're going to get rejected.

Afraid that a customer is going to bring up objections.

Or that it's going to become a stalemate where you have to wait until somebody gets back to you, and meanwhile you’re just sat there being ghosted...

Or, one of the other outcomes that people often fear: "We just don't have the money".

Whatever the reason, lots of people have all kinds of hangups, when the time comes to make it real. 

"Crap. Now I have do ask for the sale."

Well, it's not that you *have* to ask for a sale. But if you do, you're actually doing your buyer a favour.

Because here on your side, you have your hope for a new client, a new contract.

You would like to do the work, and solve the problem and show how great everything is once you wrap up your job!

They however, have their concerns and their fears.

They live with the nagging problem that they're looking to solve, and that they *might* want you to solve, but they don't know for sure yet.

And until you get to the point where you invite them to make a decision, that tension keeps existing, and it’s uncomfortable for both of you.

So if you can show up, at some point in your conversation, and you tell them something like:

“Say, this coaching programme we discussed - that something you would like to proceed with?"

Or:

“Is this a solution that you think would really work for your company?"

Or:

“Would you like to talk about making this real and getting started?”

Or:

"Should we have a conversation about a proposal and working together?"

When you do that, you’re [[📄 Permission --> Trust --> Vision --> Decision --> Sale|inviting them to make a decision]]. And whether that decision is a yes or no, it's going to be a resolution to them, as well as to you.

They will have clarity, and so will you. And, you will know whether or not it's worth your time to pursue the conversation with this person.

They on their side, they’ll know whether or not they accept dealing with the problem a while longer, or instead get your solution.

And in either case, whether it's yes or no, you both know where you stand. You'll both know where you can now direct your attention and energy, instead of maintaining a conversation that doesn’t resolve and that just keeps getting more obtuse, complicated, and frustrating.

When you ask for the sale, you’re doing everybody - yourself and your buyer - a favour.
