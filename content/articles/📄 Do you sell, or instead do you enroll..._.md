title: ðŸ“„ Do you sell, or instead do you enroll...?

Going into the new year, there's a single fundamental premise I'd like to equip you with, for all your interactions with people, be it buyers or team members or personal relationships:

Enroll, don't sell.

Which means: instead of trying to make people do what you want them to do, seek instead to enable their decision-making.

In other words, treat selling as nothing more or less than choice-enablement. Buy/don't buy, how can I help. That's all.

Because that simple attitude prevents you from falling into the persuasion-trap, where you're trying to convince the other person of the use or the validity of our point of view, or indeed, when weâ€™re trying to goad or coerce someone else into some sort of action or decision.

And whenever we fall into that attitude, the results vary from â€˜tiring and pointlessâ€™ to â€˜outright disastrousâ€™. (Also see: [[ðŸ“„ What to do when "the face ain't listening"]])

Force and persuasion may work in certain situations, but always at a high cost.

Youâ€™ll find it far easier, more productive, and a lot more fun, to simply enroll people.

And you do that by stepping into the other personâ€™s world, also known as '[[ðŸ“„ How to make selling easier by looking at your buyer's perspective|perspective-taking]]'.

Do that, and theyâ€™ll feel safe.

In the other personâ€™s world, you donâ€™t have to state your case, or present a compelling argument or reason against their objections.

All you need to do is figure out whatâ€™s happening there, in that world, and identify which changes you can make about yourself and your narrative, so as to facilitate some process, or decision-making, or buy-in from the other person.

Itâ€™s said that â€˜nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you careâ€™, and itâ€™s true.

This is why taking the attitude of enrolling people is so effective.

They feel safe, they can tell that you care about them, and so theyâ€™ll be more willing to enroll in whatever solution you present.

Where it comes to relationships and communication, the solution when you meet resistance is rarely â€˜more forceâ€™.

But that's exactly the trap we tend to fall into: we use 'force' in terms of explaining harder, making a better case, appealing to their reason and common sense.

But using force means youâ€™re making it about yourself, and about how right you know you are. Which you may or may not be, but whether you are or not doesnâ€™t matter.

What matters is: asserting that youâ€™re right makes the issue about you.

But if you want people to buy, your best bet is to enroll them, and you do that [[ðŸ“„ Never convince, never persuade|by making it about them], and that causes them to enroll themselves.
