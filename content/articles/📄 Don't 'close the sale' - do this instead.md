Iâ€™ve never liked the idea of â€˜closing a sale'.

To me, that phrasing is the complete opposite of what actually happens when somebody buys.

Sure: At that moment, at the point of purchase, you might technically 'close the sale', but the buyer *opens up something new*.

Consider:

You buy new shoes, and within days your knees or your back stop hurting.

You buy a new mattress, and wake up more rested than you have in years.

You hire a professional to do a specialised job for you, and suddenly youâ€™re in the safety and comfort of knowing that the hairy and tricky problem that was blocking your business, is now being taken care of by an expert. 

A new car, computer, or phone: what a joy to use a brand new piece of kit!

All these, and all other purchases, have one thing in common:

They open up a new phase in the life of the buyer.

Not only that: when people buy, they open up a new version of the relationship they have with you or your brand.

A purchase means the buyer opens up a phase of change.

So if you don't know how to get a buyer over the line, or you're conflicted about selling, or you don't know [[ðŸ“„ Permission & asking for the sale|how to ask for the sale]], remember this:

Trying to 'close a sale' is far less effective - and much less fun - than inviting your buyer to step into change.
