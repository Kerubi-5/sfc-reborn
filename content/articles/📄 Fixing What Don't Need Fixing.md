Letâ€™s follow up on my article from last week, [[ðŸ“„ Growing your business - the case for not fixing things|about trying to fix one thing, when fixing  something else might be a better idea.]]

Consider this example: A while ago, a client asked questions about getting onto Twitter. How it works, what the best strategy is, and so on.

I gave her some ideas, but then I asked about the why. What would be the logic?

After all, this client had a fairly strong presence on Facebook, and is wildly admired by her followers.

Not thousands of followers, but still: engagement is engagement, and those who like her, love her.

You measure engagement in strength first, and numbers second.

So if it had been my business, Iâ€™d have left Twitter for what it is, and focused on increasing my Facebook visibility.

After all, doesnâ€™t it make sense to improve what already works - instead of adding on something new? If there's people on Facebook who like her, shouldn't she figure out how to find more of them in the same place, rather than starting the very steep learning curve of a completely different platforms?

It might be the most strategic choice to optimise something good into something better, by learning and getting smarter and more strategic - instead of taking away time from it, just so you can invest that time into a platform where youâ€™re starting from scratch.

Obviously, this is not a matter of what Martin thinks is the right or the wrong choice - thatâ€™s always up to the individual.

But, Iâ€™ll always ask the strategic questions: is this the easiest way to fix the problem at hand?

Because very often, we take the long way round. We choose an action that gets results, but at the cost of not getting at the low-hanging fruit.

Or worse, we choose the wrong solution entirely, instead of simply fixing the most logical and obvious problem, and that really ain't no way to live.
