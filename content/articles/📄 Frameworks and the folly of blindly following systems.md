title: üìÑ Frameworks and the folly of blindly following systems

Social media strategies, sales conversations, lead generation, standard operating procedures for creating and publishing content‚Ä¶

Most anything can be turned into a system.

And the promise that ‚Äòa system‚Äô holds is very alluring, which is why there are so many gurus out there hawking plug-and-play systems for business.

From doing keyword research to updating websites to setting appointments with potential clients:

Someone, somewhere out there, has a box for sale that is supposed to do it for you.

And some of those systems are really good - but by themselves, applied without consideration and strategy, they're not likely to help you very much..

If you buy a system without understanding the underlying framework, you are extremely likely to end up in the category of buyers who say "It‚Äôs good but it didn‚Äôt work for me".

See, no system is applicable as-is, in all possible contexts and situations.

In the majority of cases, you‚Äôll want to make small, strategic adjustments.

Modify wording, or frequency, or your pitch‚Ä¶ do your hashtag research differently or use a slightly different layout for your ebook or break some rule or other.

No matter what promise a seller of systems makes when they offer you something to help your business growth:

There's no system that works out of the box, unattended and automatically.

If you want to use a system, make sure you understand how that black box works, so you can tune it to work for you.

This, incidentally, is exactly why Martin built me:

To provide you with a system designed for you to interact with, so that over time, the app trains you to better handle your pipeline and your sales.
