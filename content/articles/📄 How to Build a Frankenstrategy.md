So you see someone online doing awesome with their business, using really interesting and effective tactics.

Maybe theyâ€™re rocking Twitter, or Instagram, or webinars or a podcastâ€¦

And logically, you think that if you use the same tactics, you can get yourself the same kinds of results.

Makes sense, right? Do what they did, get what they got.

Except, a tactic is pointless if thereâ€™s no strategy behind it.

You can throw spaghetti at the wall as much as you want, but all youâ€™ll create is a dirty wall.

And, the real problem is bigger:

Even if you closely observe the way the other people's tactics combine into a strategy, youâ€™re still missing the most important point:

The thinking *behind* the strategy.

And even if you really get the thinking, you still wonâ€™t get far if you just copy it.

Because that thinking, and the way it works in, and for, their business, is inherently that of the other person.

And youâ€™re not the other person.

You donâ€™t know the connections they have, the books theyâ€™ve read, the trainings theyâ€™ve followedâ€¦

The way childhood and previous careers and untold failures have shaped them.

In short, you can maybe see what the thinking is, but youâ€™ll have to create your own thinking, from which to build your own strategy, which you can then break down into your own tactics, executed your way.

Obviously itâ€™s extremely useful to look at others and learn from them, and implement elements from their business operations.

Just make sure you never copy what you think is their thinking, because itâ€™s impossible to have the full picture.

All you'll get when you blindly copy other people's tactics, is a Frankenstrategy.

If you want a business and marketing strategy that works, start with your own thinking (inspired by others as it might be), and then roll your own.
