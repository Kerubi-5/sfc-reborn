Itâ€™s easy to miss when weâ€™re doing it:

Those moments when weâ€™re trying to persuade someone, when we try convince them of the usefulness or the validity of our point of view, or indeed: when weâ€™re trying to goad someone else into some sort of action or decision.

And whenever we fall into that attitude, the results vary from â€˜tiring and pointlessâ€™ to â€˜[[ðŸ“„ How to Make a Buyer Wrong, and Lose the Sale|outright disastrousâ€™]].

[[ðŸ“„ Never convince, never persuade|A buyer shouldnâ€™t be persuaded]], but instead should be shown an insight about the purchase - one that helps them decide whether or not to make that purchase.

A child shouldnâ€™t be forced to eat their veggies - your job as a parent is to figure out what makes them want to eat them. (tough job, from what I hear).

When an employee underperforms, threatening to fire them isnâ€™t helpful. Much better to figure out whatâ€™s going on that prevents them from being their best. After all, thereâ€™s always a reason.

Force and persuasion may work in certain situations, but always at a high cost.

Youâ€™ll find it far easier, more productive, and a lot more fun, to simply enroll people.

And you do that by stepping into the other personâ€™s world, also known as 'perspective-taking'.

Do that, and theyâ€™ll feel safe.

In the other personâ€™s world, you donâ€™t have to state your case, or convince or present a compelling argument or anything like that.

All you need to do is figure out whatâ€™s happening there, in that world, and identify which changes <em>you can make about yourself and your narrative,</em> so as to *facilitate* a process of decision-making, in the other person, causing them to buy in voluntarily.

Itâ€™s said that â€˜nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you careâ€™, and itâ€™s true.

This is why taking the attitude of enrolling people is so effective.

They feel safe, they can tell that you care about them, and so theyâ€™ll be more willing to enroll in whatever solution you present.

Where it comes to relationships and communication, the solution when you meet resistance is rarely â€˜more forceâ€™.

But that's exactly the trap we tend to fall into: we use 'force' in terms of explaining harder, making a better case, appealing to their reason and common sense.

But using force means youâ€™re making it about yourself, and about how right you know you are. Which you may or may not be, but whether you are or not doesnâ€™t matter.

What matters is that asserting that youâ€™re right makes the issue about you.

If you want to enroll people and create the kind of results that everyone benefits from, youâ€™ll need to make it about <em>them</em>.

And you do that by stepping into their world.

That's where the magic - and the sale - happens. In the buyer's world.

You want to learn how to do that - how to enroll buyers without ever having to push or persuade and convince?
