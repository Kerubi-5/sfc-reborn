There‚Äôs a reason why imprisonment is the punishment of choice across the world.

Not because it‚Äôs necessarily effective, but because as punishments go, it does one of the worst things you can do to someone:

To remove a person‚Äôs autonomy.

For someone to no longer be a free agent, to not control their own decisions, is horrible.

And in selling your work, removing the other's autonomy is pretty much the worst possible thing you could do.

Right? Who in their right minds would ever want to tell a buyer what they should do?

I'll bet you agree, and yet:

It‚Äôs staggering to see how many people (unwittingly) end up removing the buyer‚Äôs autonomy.

Now you probably think ‚ÄúYeah, but that‚Äôs not me‚Äù.

Are you sure though?

Because:

When you try to persuade someone‚Ä¶

When you try to convince someone by making a powerful argument‚Ä¶

When you try to overcome someone‚Äôs objections, fears, or doubts‚Ä¶ and you continue to make your case‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs when you are in fact, in a subtle way or not, removing a buyer‚Äôs autonomy. The more you argue your point, the more you're signalling "My being right is supposed to be the rule here, if only you would see that".

Which makes you the authority and they lose autonomy. And because that‚Äôs the worst thing you can do to a human being, it‚Äôs not very likely to result in a sale - and *if* it does, chances are you‚Äôll end up dealing with buyer‚Äôs remorse or other problems.

It‚Äôs never a good idea to push someone into a sale (or, indeed, a point of view).

What is a good idea though, is to invite someone in.

*Invite* them to consider a viewpoint.

Invite them to consider a purchase.

Invite them to ask you questions, or even better:

Invite them to tell you what concerns they have.

Inviting people to go along with you has the opposite effect of pushing people:

Instead of them putting up barriers, they‚Äôll lower their guard and consider what you‚Äôre telling them, they'll tell you what they want and what their challenges are.

And if at some point they accept the invitation to buy, they do so under full control and autonomy, and you bet that‚Äôs [[üìÑ The Shift in serving customers even before they buy|a way to buy that people love]].

Any time that something feels like an uphill battle with people, you're probably trying to *push* your agenda - so stop that, and instead start *inviting*.
