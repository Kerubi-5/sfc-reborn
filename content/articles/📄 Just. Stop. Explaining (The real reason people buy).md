What, actually, is at the heart of a decision to make a purchase?

Itâ€™s not because of a desire to own.

Not because of disposable income.

Status isnâ€™t it, nor is 'adding value to their lives'.

People donâ€™t buy because of persuasion or a good sales pitch.

People donâ€™t buy in order to invest, or to feel good about themselves, or because it makes them happy or because it solves a problem.

All those things, and many more, are part of the reasons, but none of them are at the core.

The real, ultimate reason to buy, the one cause thatâ€™s at the root of [[ðŸ“„ Weird fact - explaining why the purchase is a good idea slows down the sale|all other reasons]], is simple.

When people decide to purchase your work, it's because they feel understood.

When a vendor - of anything - manages to make a person *feel* that their problem is understood and will be solved by proceeding to checkout, thatâ€™s when a sale happens.

And this is why a salesperson who listens more than he or she talks will have far easier time finding buyers who convert.

Because if your sales arenâ€™t happening, you need to ask yourself:

Are you explaining - are you trying making yourself understood?

Or, instead, are you *making your prospect feel understood...?*

If the former is the case, you might want to change tack, because more explaining wonâ€™t make a buyer feel understood.

But more listening [[ðŸ“„ How to use the L.I.V.E. model to prevent sales from breaking|just might]]. Probably will.
