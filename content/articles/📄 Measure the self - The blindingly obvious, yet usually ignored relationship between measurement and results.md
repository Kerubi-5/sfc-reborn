Everyone is always going on about measurement and tracking and numbers and growth...

But only the few, only the smart, measure what matters most: the self.

Yet curiously, that most important thing is often the last thing we â€˜measureâ€™, if at all.

Where 'measuring the self' means measuring your performance, not your height or waist-size. And, I'm not talking about performance data from devices like Fitbit, either.

What's more: when I say 'performance', that doesn't mean how many calls you made, or emails replied to, or the number of Pomodoro work sessions you ran.

Performance in the world of SalesFlowCoach means:

How did you show up to your job today?

How much did you exert yourself?

How much responsibility did you take for getting to 'job well done'?

How hard did you say no to distractions?

How many excuses did you make for not getting done what you said you'd do?

How well did you live up to your chosen self-identity, as a person responsible for driving results?

You might think questions like those don't matter, because 'resolve & discipline will get you to the measured results that actually matter, like calls made, sales closed and revenue generated', but:

Discipline won't get you there.

Resolve won't do the trick.

Sure: When you set a goal, for the year or the month, you obviously need to measure the results, like sales and revenue and proposals and so on.

But those are [[ðŸ“„ Leading vs lagging - are you looking at the right metrics?|lagging metrics]]: they show up as the result of the leading metrics that come before.

The thing that will actually get you towards your goals are different. You could call them 'soft metrics', because they're extremely subjective and they're extremely hard to quantify.

Those soft metrics, they are primarily about the way you show up to work.

Meaning: the way you handle the tasks you need to execute on, the attitude you perform with, the rigour you apply to the job at hand - do you measure those?

You might want to start, because if you don't you'll inevitably have far too many days where you're not really applying yourself - and you know you won't reach your goals by 'phoning it in'.

The solution?

Give yourself 5 minutes at the end of each day, and reflect on the Soft Metrics Questions, and start increasing the level of *quality* that you bring to your work.
