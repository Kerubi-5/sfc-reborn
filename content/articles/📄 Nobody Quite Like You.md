One of the most rewarding - and joyful - things about my work as a coach, is helping people get clear on what they‚Äôre REALLY very good at.

Gay Hendrix refers to it as the zone of genius in *The Big Leap*, and it means: that thing that you do, that nobody else does quite the way you do it.

And more often than not, we don‚Äôt realise what it is, this superpower - and if we do, we tend to take it for granted.

"Oh it's nothing special, I‚Äôve done it all my life‚Äù.

Maybe, but: to YOU it might not seem very special, since you‚Äôre so used to it and it comes so naturally. Second nature, you don‚Äôt even have to think about it - but that effortless grace you display in doing that thing, that‚Äôs exactly what makes it so irresistible and powerful in the perception of others.

Examples: connecting people, communicating astutely, creating design or strategy that just works, building a network, ethical selling, inspiring people‚Ä¶ all these are potential superpowers, depending on the individual.

And if you have one (hint: you do, no matter how insecure you are or how much you under-appreciate yourself) you‚Äôd better get deliberate about using that skill to its fullest, and finding ways to maximise your time spent doing that, staying in that Zone of Genius.

Because remember: there‚Äôs nobody in the world who does that thing quite the way you do it - and you can earn a lot of money for doing it.

(Note: This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be the best at it - the zone of genius is about your doing something in a way that‚Äôs highly effective, in a way that nobody else could copy.)

But exactly because it comes naturally to us, we tend to ignore its potential. We busy ourselves with much low-level activity, stuff you could easily outsource, while being ignorant of the ease and grace with which results could show up, if only we‚Äôd make our superpower our main focus.

So ask yourself: what is your superpower - your Zone of Genius?

And: what if you‚Äôd scrap a bunch of rote-tasks and keep-the-joint-running activities, and replace them with [[üìÑ What you working on? (Zone of Genius)|working in that Zone of Genius]]‚Ä¶ what would that do for your business and your revenue?

Here's why I'm asking: 

I'll bet that you're a great friend to have, someone people respect, and ask advice from, and enjoy spending time with - in other words, 'being a friend' is very likely part of your Zone of Genius. 

What if your sales conversations itself could become like that - what if selling your work would be as fun, easy, and rewarding, as spending time with a friend?

It's not that hard - just depends on how you approach the sales conversation.
