Isn't it weird how sometimes a sale stalls, right when everything lines up?

"Well that's great stuff - I'm thrilled you want to get my help, because we can do some terrific work together".

Your buyer nods and smiles: yep, this sales is about to close.

And you continue:

"Let me send you a contract and payment details, and then we can get started next week."

But then your buyer says "Just give me a few days to think on it", or they agree but a week later they still haven't signed or paid.

What happened? Wasn't this practically a done deal?

Maybe, but a more important question was:

Did you inadvertently give your buyer a feeling that you were too fast or too aggressive?

It's a delicate moment, when you ask for the sale, and it's easy to screw it up.

That's why a better way to ask, is by [[ðŸ“„ Why you need permission in sales and with people, and how to get it at four different levels|*first asking permission*]].

Instead of "I'll send you XYZ", say:

"Do you want me to send you the contract and payment details?"

If they say yes, then you have their full permission and agreement for sending them the stuff they need to make the sale real.

Or, they'll say "Not yet, I need to think about it first", or give another reason why not.

Which is terrifically helpful, because then you both know where you stand - you won't be assuming they're one signature away from buying, and they won't be followed up for a sale that they haven't decided on yet.

So when it gets to the point where you need to [[ðŸ“„ The worst question, that nearly every seller asks - and what to ask instead|ask for the sale]], ask permission for asking, first:

"Do you mind if we talk about a contract and cost?"
