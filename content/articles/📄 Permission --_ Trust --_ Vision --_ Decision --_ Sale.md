A potential client will only make a decision to buy, when they are good and ready - and that means, they need to *see* themselves enjoying the benefit of having bought your solution.

Thatâ€™s the *vision* element of a sales process: getting to the point where [[ðŸ“„ How to get a buyer to be interested in your vision?|they too see the vision that you have for them]].

But before theyâ€™ll buy in to that vision, they need to trust you.

Unless thereâ€™s trust, theyâ€™re not going to have that vision.

And, in order to gain trust, you need to gain permission first.

Permission to explain, permission to ask questions, and, yes: Permission to ultimately ask for the sale.

And so selling in an ethical way, where you have sales conversations that people enjoy, works like this:

First, you gain permission - to explore their situation, assess [[ðŸ“„ Purchase motivators - Problem-cost and urgency|the problem and how much it would cost to keep it]], to address objections, to discover what they need.

Do that right, and youâ€™ll earn their trust. Trust that youâ€™re looking out for them, that youâ€™re not just in it for the money, and - very importantly - that your product or service is what they need, and that itâ€™ll solve their problem.

That trust causes your buyer to get curious, to ask *you* questions - and that is what builds a vision in their minds.

And once that vision is ready, and theyâ€™ve sold themselves on wanting your thing - thatâ€™s when you get to ask for the sale, and thatâ€™s when they make the decision to buy or not to buy.

And if they donâ€™t, you graciously accept their no, and you continue the conversation (i.e. you follow up in a pleasant way) until such time that they *are* ready.

*Everything starts with permission*, and if you try to sell without gaining permission first, all you're doing is effectively trying to coerce your buyer.

"I want to do a little exploration of the situation here, is that ok?"

"Do you mind if I double-click on what you just said?"

"Would you mind if I ask you to tell me the dollar-amount you lose there each month?"

"Is this a good moment to talk about working together?"

Your buyer says yes, and you gain permission. You're driving the sale forward in the most ethical and collaborative way possible.
