When dealing with a buyer, there's effectively three different modes of communicating.

The first one is when you waffle. Your narrative is unstructured, you jump from one topic to the next, you chat about the weather, you're not driving towards and outcome or goal, you don't [[ðŸ“„ Sell Stewardship]], and you generally waste your time as well as that of your buyer.

This often comes from a sense of insecurity, or neediness, or both.

The second is where you pitch. Features! Benefits! Our award-winning consulting service and our zero-risk guarantee policy!

It might work sometimes, but it's rarely fun - and if your prospect doesn't buy then and there, there's a good chance you'll get ghosted when you follow up.

Because if you act like a pushy salesperson, you get treated like one: you get ignored.

Then there's the modality of exploring, questioning, problem-finding, and helping your buyer get to clarity and a decision.

That modality is fun, useful, and received with gratitude.

Oh, and it's the type of conversation that makes buyers enroll themselves, which means you don't have to pitch and you don't have to feel awkward or needy or insecure.

As I've said before: Don't try to talk your way to the sale - instead, all you need to do is ask your way to the sale.
