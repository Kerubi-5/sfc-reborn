Of course nobody wants to give money to their competitors. 

Things is though, practically every business out there does it, and you might be doing it as well.

Here’s why:

You, like any other business, have a bunch of opportunities to serve people.

To earn money, and have an impact, whatever it is you do - and you have those opportunities, because you have a database.

Even if you've never formally put together the names into a database, you have lists:

Past clients, current clients, prospects, people who could be an ally, people who would partner with you, people you've met at meetups and conferences...

All the people in your world that you've been in contact with, and where you're both relevant to each other in some way: that's your database.

Every business has one - but nearly every business under-utilises the potential there.

When you don't show up and talk to the people who need what you do...

Well, then they might not remember you when the time comes to buy a solution.

Or, they might not have the clarity on what you could do for them, and how you could solve their problem in a way that makes them want to buy from you, instead of from someone else.

If somebody wants a solution for this or that problem, and they need solution XYZ, and they need it now, they're going to look for whoever is the most qualified in their eyes to solve that problem for them.

And they're going to go and pay that person.

And if that's not you, simply because you have not done your job in talking to people, well, then you're effectively giving money to your competitors.

So what you want to do is look at your database starting with your past buyers, go through the names, and see what these people have bought in the past.

Then, ask yourself:

What challenges or problems might the be facing?

Where might they be at?

What would they need right now?

What should you ask them, to learn whether or not there's a job to be done together?

Next, you figure out what kind of message you need to put in front of them, so that they're aware that you might be the most qualified and the best solution for their problem.

In other words: you need to talk to your people - whether it's directly with meetings, or by publishing content:

You need to show up, in a relevant way, and engage with the people who know you.

That’s how you leverage the asset of all the relationships and connections in your business.

There’s people out there who need you - if not now, then at some point.

Because if you don't, they'll likely make a purchase elsewhere, and then you are indeed giving money to your competitors.
