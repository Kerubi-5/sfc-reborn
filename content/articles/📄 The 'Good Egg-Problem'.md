Most people I come across in my work  are terrific people, with values such as integrity and truthfulness high up in their list of priorities.

Which is awesome, because itâ€™s great to deal with people who share the same values as we do.

But the more people I meet, the more it seems that the higher on the scale of integrity someone is, the more conflicted their relationship with selling - and as a consequence, the lower their success rate in terms of signing on clients.

I call it the â€˜good egg-problemâ€™, where high integrity is (actually: seems to be) correlated to low sales results.

But listen: if you live by values, then logically the work that you do is good, worth the money, and something that people ought to buy, right?

They buy, [[ðŸ“„ On selling, entitlement, and service|you serve]], and thatâ€™s how you make your money. Right?

Then why not take the sting out of â€˜sellingâ€™, and let your values guide you?

As in: if integrity matters to you, and you want to do right by people, then helping someone make a decision *is* doing right by people - and selling really is nothing more than facilitating a decision-making process.

Besides, youâ€™re not going to force anyone into buying anyway, because integrity says we donâ€™t do things like that.

So youâ€™re there to have a conversation about a choice the other person is considering.

You help them get clarity, identify desire, discuss doubts and objections, and figure out if your thing is right for them, at this moment.

And, since integrity is central to your life, you happily accept yes or no, depending on whatâ€™s right for that other person.

Solving the 'good-egg problem' means that the only outcome that youâ€™re attached to, is [[ðŸ“„ Wanting Something from People VS Wanting Something for People|for your buyer to make the right decision.]]
