Being in business has many upsides: you call the shots, you set your prices, you are the only one you’re accountable to, you plan your days and vacations as you want, etc…

And, to have all that, we know that there’s a price to pay:

Long hours, patience, trial and error, sacrifice, and so on. And as an entrepreneur, we’re happy to pay that price.

But there’s one price nobody should pay:

Losing out on buyers who ought to have bought.

Think about it: for each prospect you enter into conversation with, you have to spend time, money, and elbow-grease in order for that person and you to connect.

And yeah, it’s a fact of business that you’ll never ever convert every prospect into a buyer - they might not have the budget, maybe timing isn’t right for them, or maybe what you offer isn’t exactly what they need.

But what about people who do have the money, who do need what you have, and who do want it, and they want it now… except in the end, for some reason, they didn’t buy?

Horrible feeling isn’t it? Everything looked so good, ducks in a row, stars aligned, and then: "Damn. Another one that got away".

Emotionally this can be devastating. But it can also cause your business to itself to fail, if it happens too often.

Because, again, for each prospect you meet, you have to work, and if you fail to convert those who could be, ought to be buyers, you’re losing on the most scarce resource available to you: your time.

The solution?

Learn how to get good at selling. Whether by working with me, reading books, listening to podcasts or going to trainings: the one skill that will make or break a business, is the ability to enroll people.

And guess what: when you learn how to enroll in a way that’s based on empathy and values, it’s fun, a lot easier, and you’ll never have to convince or persuade anyone.

If any of this resonates with you and you feel that yes, the time has come to develop your enrollment skills, <a href="mailto:hello@martinstellar.com">reply to this email.</a>

We’ll set up a time for a short chat to see if Sales For Nice People will get you to your goals - and no, I won’t try to convince or persuade you... If you want my help, I imagine you'll let me know.

Either way: if your personal efforts don't yield results and returns, you're paying a cost you shouldn't have to pay, and you'd do well to get better at enrolling buyers, one way or another.
