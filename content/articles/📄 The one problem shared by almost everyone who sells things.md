Over the years, working with hundreds of coaches and consultants, and conducting hundreds upon hundreds of interviews, there's one fatal flaw that nearly every single business owner has:

Not spending enough time, energy, and dedication, on working the opportunities for sales that exist.

In other words:

Hardly anyone really works their pipeline, properly and diligently, documenting and logging as your deals move forward.

Now don't feel bad - you're not alone.

Even professional sales people need a manager to egg them on.

"Make the calls!"

"Do followup!"

"Get out there and meet people!"

"Update the CRM"

Problem is, neither working a CRM (Customer Relationship Manager), nor doing followup, nor making calls, is what gets you sales in a reliable, predictable, repeatable way.

No, if you want to generate leads, advance the deals, and move qualified buyers into becoming a client, you'll need to commit time to it, and return to the process every day.

But then you (and pro sales reps and everyone else) run into a problem:

You look at your database (whether it's a CRM, a spreadsheet or a notebook), and you lose all clarity and steam.

These people stopped replying...

Those ones don't have the money...

That one just became a father and is out of the running...

Those people were interested in something you no longer offer...

What a mess, where do you start? How do you possibly generate a client out of that sad list of people in your world?

The answer is: you don't.

Here's [[ðŸ“„ Why you should clean up the deadwood and get rid of deals|what to do instead]].
