They might seem like a perfect client for you, and they might seem really keen on working with you... and yet:

Indecisiveness, vacillating, no decision.

Itâ€™s a yes, but not a â€˜hell yesâ€™.

Whenever youâ€™re in a situation like that, be careful not to break the trust buyer is building up.

And that doesn't mean trust in you - there's a far more delicate type of trust that a buyer needs, and it's *trusting that buying is the right decision*.

And thatâ€™s where many sales break.

They're on the fence, we want to help, and so we try to convince, explain, persuade, try yet another compelling argument.

The result?

We look needy, and the buyer shies away.

Whereas if you take it easy, sit back, ask more questions and take the pressure off, youâ€™ll often find that the buyer shares concerns that havenâ€™t been addressed yet.

Or, it might turn out they're simply not ready yet, for whatever reason is relevant in their world.

And when you can handle that â€˜not readyâ€™ elegantly, with a "No problem, letâ€™s talk again in a few weeks", thereâ€™s a very big chance that when next you talk, theyÂ will be ready.

But if they arenâ€™t, and you try to persuade them?

Then they probably wonâ€™t be open to you following up, and when you do theyâ€™ll feel that same kind of indecisiveness that stopped them in the first place - if not outright resistance.

A sale is a good thing for you, of course. And you should strive to get those sales.

But a sale is never right if itâ€™s not the perfect time for the buyer.

After all, your business exists to serve your buyer, and your sales process should serve them just as much.

That's the whole secret of ethical selling: to make the sales process itself an [[ðŸ“„ The Shift in serving customers even before they buy|act of service]].

And so long as you don't try to rush or force things, sales will close, when the time is right - and they close faster than if you were to try and goad people into it.
