It's said that everything is marketing, and that's true.

On a much deeper level though, _everything you do is a signal._ And, everything you perceive is a signal.

Proper listening signals to the other: you and your story matter to me.

The husband hiding behind his newspaper (or being glued to his phone screen) signals: youâ€™re not a priority.

Sending out useful daily emails signals: Iâ€™m not just in it for the money, I intend to serve as well.

(Have you started daily emails yet? I highly recommend it).

Lashing out at someone signals: my upset state is more important than harmony, collaboration and understanding.

Everything that you do in your life sends some sort of signal to others.

The problem is that in 99% of the cases, weâ€™re unaware of what signal weâ€™re sending.

We go about our business, act as best as can, but we donâ€™t stop to think what message, or signal, weâ€™re broadcasting.

And then it gets worse, when we donâ€™t stop to notice how our signal is being perceived.

This is the cause for a huge number of problems in relationships (business or personal) and in society as well.

But itâ€™s so easy to see! People literally tell us how our signals are being perceived!

Whether by how they respond, or body language, or action, or inaction: your world gives you constant and direct feedback on how well your signals are working for you.

The trick to getting better results with people - and more sales - is to step out of your silo, and to open up to the signals that are being returned to you.

The responses to your own signals: those are what tell you *what it is that you actually said.*

Because what you think you said, or intended to say, is nowhere near as important as *the message that got heard.*

Itâ€™s never the otherâ€™s job to figure out what it is you meant.

Instead, itâ€™s your job to figure out the best way, for getting your message and your signal perceived the way you intended.

You live in a perfectly tuned feedback system called â€˜the worldâ€™, that tells you your efficacy in signaling, 24/7.

It's there to tell you how you're doing, so it would be wise to pay attention.
