When you have something for someone - a product or service, or a plan, or a great idea, or a different viewpoint youâ€™d like them to try - you know *why* itâ€™s a good thing or a good idea.

You have reasons - and you know that they are valid.

You, with full confidence, know that:

Theyâ€™ll be happy with the purchase, itâ€™ll solve their problem.

Theyâ€™ll enjoy the restaurant you have in mind.

Your kids will grow up healthy and strong, if they eat their veggies.

Folks will enjoy the movie or the book you have in mind for them.

Your coaching client will totally triumph, if they do that thing you're recommending.

In short: your reasons for wanting them to want what you have, see, or think, are solid and correct.

Except thereâ€™s one problem:

People donâ€™t buy (or buy in) because of your reasons, no matter how valid those reasons may be.

No, when people buy something or enroll in something, they do it for *their* reasons. Not yours.

[[ðŸ“„ How to ruin a sale by being helpful|And thatâ€™s where so much communication (and indeed: sales) breaks down.]]

We try to persuade, convince, influenceâ€¦ we try to reason with the other person.

"See my reasons! Hear me out, because you should XYZ because of... /reasons!"

### But people need their own reasonsâ€¦Â 

Once they find those, they enroll themselves - they buy in willingly and voluntarily, into whatever good idea you have for them.

And no matter how much you try to reason with them:

In doing so, youâ€™re only making it harder for them to discover their *own* reasons, and thus you slow down the sale.

So instead of trying to reason with the other person, appeal to their desire for change.

Give them space to figure out *if* they want the thing or idea you have, and most importantly:

*Why* they would want it.

Itâ€™s not your reasons that make people buy or buy in: itâ€™s their reasons.

Help the other person discover those, for themselves, and they'll sell themselves on wanting what you have for them.
