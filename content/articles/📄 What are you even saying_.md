title: 📄 What are you even saying?
---

In teaching, it’s said that we should speak at the level of understanding of the student - and it’s exactly the same in sales.

Because the majority of missed opportunities in terms of converting a prospect into a buyer, can be fixed with simple messaging.

Makes no difference whether your buyer is talking to you or reading your website.

And, it makes no difference how good your offer is:

If you don’t speak your buyer’s language, there’s no sale.

Engineers and developers are an example of profiles who are especially prone to mis-messaging:

Jargon this, API that, data-driven such-and-so, and the buyer goes: “What?”

But not just engineers: we all tend to approach our messaging from our own point of view.

And that just doesn’t work.

Instead, you need to take _your buyer’s point of view_.

That’s why I always say:

Learn your people.

Find out why they are reading you, or talking to you.

Learn their fears & frustrations, wants and aspirations, and speak to them in the languaging that reflects those.

That’s how you get rapport, buy-in, and sales.

This is why researching your audience is so important, because that’s when you learn what words your buyers use.

And then you can _use_ those words in your messaging, and they’ll go “Huh. This person gets me”.

When you’re talking to a buyer, listen closely to how they word things, and use that same wording in your statements.

You’ll be amazed how this will transform your sales conversations.

Meanwhile, wishing you a wonderful time with your loved ones, and happy AllTheThings.

See you next week - I'm excited because my team and I are cooking up some really cool stuff for you, to be released in the new year. Stay tuned...
