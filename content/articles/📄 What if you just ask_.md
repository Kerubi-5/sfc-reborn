title: 📄 What if you just ask?
---

People get so hung up on the selling thing.

Psychological resistance, self-value considerations, fear of looking pushy…

And a therapist could have a field day working through it all with you, but really: selling is nothing very special.

It’s a person-to-person thing. Two people trying to figure out a way forward - or not, as the case may be.

And what’s more human and natural than talking to someone, and helping them make a decision?

As for that ‘looking pushy’ thing:

Why?

Just ask people the right question, the kind that shows that you have their interest at heart?

Like:

“Would it make sense to talk again next week?”

“Is it useful to you if I remind you in a month?”

“Is this a good time to talk about what it would look like to work together?”

“Sounds like solving that problem would have a big impact on your business. Should we look at ways I might be able to help you?”

“Given what you’ve told me about the problem and you agree that my work will help, would you say it is time to solve the problem?”

"Do you want to move forward on this and get started?"

See, you don’t need to force, or push, or anything like that.

Just ask.

Everything gets easier when you ask.

Ask for permission, ask for insight, ask for info… and yes, when appropriate: ask for the sale - or, if the deal stalls or you're [[📄 How do I stop being ghosted?|getting ghosted]]: ask for a 'No'.

No pushing, just a question.

You’ll be surprised how well people respond when you ask 'you-questions', instead of trying to persuade people.
