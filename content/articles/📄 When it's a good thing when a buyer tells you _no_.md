Which is, basically, always. "No" is nowhere near as bad as you think.

Okay sure, itâ€™s never fun when someone decides to not buy from you.

But really, you ought to welcome it. Because a No is the start of a relationship.

Not a professional relationship, sure. Doesnâ€™t help your businessâ€¦ YET.

But follow my thinking here: most people consider a failed sale as an endpoint. Closed case. One of those that got away.

But thatâ€™s a shame, because you never know when someone ends up being ready to get down to business.

Could be a week, a month, or a year.

And all you need to do in order to land the sale when that time comes, is maintain a relationship with people.

Ask a question. Stay in touch. Share a book when you find one thatâ€™s perfect for them. See what theyâ€™re up to on social media. Answer a question, exchange emails.

You know: be a human being - which comes down to â€˜being nice peopleâ€™.

Lots of clients end up working with me months, or even years, after initially saying â€˜nopeâ€™. 

Those are sales that wouldnâ€™t have happened if I hadnâ€™t stayed in touch and kept the relationship alive.

That â€˜noâ€™ you might dread so much?
