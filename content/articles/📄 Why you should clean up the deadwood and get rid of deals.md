title: 📄 Why you should clean up the deadwood and get rid of deals
---

When everything seems stuck or miserable, one of the best things you can do is cull your list, clean up the deadwood, and get rid of the deals that shouldn't be in your pipeline.

Look, it would be great if every deal in your pipeline would ultimately turn into a sale.

But that's an illusion: only a percentage will become a sale, and only a percentage of that will do that in the next couple of weeks or months.

The worst thing you could do is act as if every deal is equal, because you'd keep your pipeline full of dross and rubbish.

So, when things aren't working and nothing seems to move forward and you just don't know where to start:

Throw stuff away.

Clean up.

Get rid of duds, tire-kickers, and deals that you wish would close, but common sense tells you it ain't gonna happen. 

Same thing with those deals where you just wish it would turn into a sale and you're rationalising yourself into believing it can happen - but deep down in your gut, you know that it's just not going to work.

Whether you're ignoring your common sense or your - very trustworthy - gut instinct:
