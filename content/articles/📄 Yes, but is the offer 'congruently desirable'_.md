I'm not a psychologist, but I've studied the topic for decades, and I can tell you from my own experience and that of my clients and students over the years:

Everything, including your sales (especially your sales!), gets better the more you understand how people work.

And for that, there's a tonne of approaches and models in psychology, that you can directly approach to your sales process and how you run your business.

For instance, in the field of producitivity and procrastination, there's a question psychologists like to ask:

Is this goal congruently desirable?

As in: if your goal is to generate a million dollar in sales, then getting the cash is definitely desirable.

But if that also means you have to hire a team and that means your peaceful solo-trader life goes to pieces, the overal goal is not at all congruently desirable, and you bet that your subconscious is going to do whatever it can to trip you up, and prevent you from hitting the target.

And the same thing goes with your sales, your buyers and your offers:

If your offer isn't 'congruently desirable' for your buyer, there's no sale.

The outcome you promise might be 100% desirable for your buyers, but a secondary consequence of that offer might be - very often is - the reason why a deal won't move forward despite all the stars being seemingly aligned.

In other words, you might be 'selling them a problem', along with your solution. (I've written about the various nefarious ways that can show up, for instance as [[ðŸ“„ Are you selling them a problem? (Pt. 1 - Interaction tax)|interaction-tax]], [[ðŸ“„ Are you selling them a problem? (Pt. 3 - Adoption cost)|adoption-cost]], and [[ðŸ“„ Are you selling them a problem? (Pt. 2 - Identity conflicts)|identity conflicts]]).

Anyway, the secret to selling effectively without ever having to resort to ineffective and respectless tactics such as scraping names off the web, and then automate sending AI-generated 'personalised' messaging - i.e. spam - is very simple:

Don't assume that just because your buyer needs and wants your solution, you have everything needed to close the sale. Because as you'll have noticed - and if you're not sure, go into your CRM and count the number of deals gone stale, that you were certain would close - the fact that a buyer needs your solution, isn't enough.

If a deal ain't happening, stop the trite 'just following up' messages, and ask yourself some intelligent questions about your buyer. Ask yourself what might be in the way, what problem or threat their subconscious might be struggling with.

And once you have an idea of what that might be, then you follow up, and then you say intelligent, considerate, response-generating things like:

"Hey that website project we discussed - I understand it's not going to happen for the time being and that's fine. But since you seemed ready to kick it off, I'm just curious - was it indeed the decision to hire more staff, that put a pinch on your website budget?"

With a question like that, you're probably not closing a sale. But unlike "Hey, just circling back!" crud, you likely won't get ignored, and you're likely able to continue the conversation, which is required for any sale to happen at any point, which it won't if you say things that get you ignored.

Anyway.

This type of approach - the thoughtful, methodical, empathy-based process of dealing with your buyers and your communications, works a charm, and it's exactly that which you'll learn in the ten-week Sales For Nice People training that starts in January, and that's part of the SFC Academy special offer that runs until the end of the year.
