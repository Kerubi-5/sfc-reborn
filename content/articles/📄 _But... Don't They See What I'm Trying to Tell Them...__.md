Isnâ€™t it frustrating, when you see a solution for someone, and they just will not buy into it?

But itâ€™s so clear to you! You KNOW that things will change for them, and for the better!

Then how come they donâ€™t enroll?

Donâ€™t they SEE? Itâ€™s so clear!

Yep, itâ€™s clear: to you.

And nope, they donâ€™t see it.

Why?

This might sound harsh or unjust, but in the end, it comes down to the cold reality called 'self-importance.'

When you find yourself failing to create a client, or someone refuses to help or collaborate, or rejects your sound reasoning and good ideas, itâ€™s because youâ€™re approaching the situation from a self-oriented point of view.

The POV is <em>your</em> POV.

And while you might have the vision, <em>they</em> will only see that vision, and buy into it, when they decide to explore that vision of yours.

And as long as your point of origin is your conviction that youâ€™ve got it right and they need to change or adjust their POV, you wonâ€™t enroll them - not as a buyer nor a collaborator.

Instead, put yourself in their shoes.

Apply empathy.

Be a researcher, an anthropologist, asking yourself incessantly "Whatâ€™s going on in that mind, in their world?"

What fears, aspirations, desires are present for them?

What is it like to be them?

Do that, and you [[ðŸ“„ How to make selling easier by looking at your buyer's perspective|make the enrollment process about them]] and their vision, instead of about your vision.

That way, people will be far more open to trying out your point of view, and youâ€™ll find yourself enrolling people with much more ease.
