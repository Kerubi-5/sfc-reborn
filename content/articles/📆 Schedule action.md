You'd be forgiven for thinking that scheduling or planning actions is a waste of time.

After all, flicking an email over at John that says "Are we still on for our 1pm meeting tomorrow?" is hardly any trouble.

But, one of the main reasons why it can be so challenging to stay on top of your pipeline, is that we tend to scatter our attention across different types of activities.

Instead, you want to operate in 'blocks of mindset', so that you don't have to pay the cost of switching from one mindset to the other.

And, you'll recognise that sending comms requires a very different mindset than does thoughtfully reviewing your pipeline and opportunities.

So: action scheduled, and next up:
