Action scheduled?

Perfect.

But don't jump into contacting people yet!

Instead, we're doing to keep asking ourselves questions about the people in your list, so that we stay nice and focused on mining our own intel and network.

Once done, that's when we'll batch-process the outreach actions that we scheduled.

Sounds good?
