> [[🔁 Workflows]] >> [[⛏️ MYNO = Mine Your Network for Opportunities|Mine Your Network for Opportunities]] >> Sort your contacts for priority

Now that we've answered questions about the people in our world, we move on to sorting them.

In Column F, you'll see an average of the scores you've entered.

Click the little arrow at the top of that column, and sort Ascending.

Now, you see the people who are the perfect combination of size, network, affinity and connector type, at the top.

These are the people we'll contact first.

But don't just go blast messages at them - you want to do this strategically, and thoughtfully.

Ready?
