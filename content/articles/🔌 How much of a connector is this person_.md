title: 🔌 How much of a connector is this person?
---

> [[🔁 Workflows]] >> [[⛏️ MYNO = Mine Your Network for Opportunities|Mine Your Network for Opportunities]] >> Is this person likely to connect or introduce you?

Some people are great at creating connections, others not so much.

So in column C, you want to rate every name for how likely you think they will be, to connect you with someone.

You might not have hard data to inform you, but given that you know these people to some degree, you'll have an idea.

Take your best guess, and rank each name from 1 (for: natural connector) to 5 (for: shields their network as if it's the Crown Jewels).

For the next step, we're asking about proximity and the depth of the relationship:

👬 **[[👬 How tight is your relationship with this person?|What level of affinity do you have with this individual?]]**
