Ok, so something needs to happen for this deal to close, and it's not completely in your control.

The thing that needs to happen, is that something your buyer needs to do?

**[[👤 My buyer needs to do something|Yes, I need my buyer to do something next]]**

**[[👤 Someone other than my buyer needs to do something|No, a third party needs to do something]]**
