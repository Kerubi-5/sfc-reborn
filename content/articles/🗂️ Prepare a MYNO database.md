In the SalesFlow Coach methodology, the process we use for Mining Your Network for Opportunities is simple:

First, we create the biggest list we can, of people who might lead us to an opportunity.

After that, we'll ask a few questions about each of those people, so that we know exactly who to contact, and what to say.

**Step 1: Open a new spreadsheet, and title column A: "Name".**

Ready?

**👀 [[🔎 Go through current and old databases & lists|Let's go have a look, and see where we can find those names...]]**
