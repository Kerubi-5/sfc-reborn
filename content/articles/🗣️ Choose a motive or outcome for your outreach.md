title: 🗣️ Choose a motive or outcome for your outreach
---

> [[🔁 Workflows]] >> [[⛏️ MYNO = Mine Your Network for Opportunities|Mine Your Network for Opportunities]] >> What outcome are you hoping for?

Here, we're looking for the second part of the following sentence:

"I'm writing, because..."

What goes into the blank space?

What's your motive, your excuse, your reason for reaching out?

Whatever your answer is, these are the two rules you need to stick with:

1: Your why has to be simple, so it can be said and understood in a simple sentence

2: It has to answer the question "what's in it for me?". Meaning: you need to make sure that interacting with you has value for the recipient.

With the notes and insights from the previous steps, you should be able to put together a short, helpful and relevant message - one that triggers the recipient to reply.
