Sure, this buyer might represent a lot of money to your business and you've got to keep your finances rolling.

But some buyers are a major pain - and if they are already giving you a headache before they buy, it'll only get worse once they do.

And while I'm sure you're able to handle it, the aggravation they cause will reduce your ability to deliver stellar service to your other buyers, or indeed your ability to work on deals with people who are a dream to work with.

Yes, it's very subjective, but if this buyer is a headache, you score them a 1. If it's a dream-person, it's a 5.
