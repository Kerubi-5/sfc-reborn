We all do it: 

Reason with ourselves, convince ourselves of something against better judgment, we ignore facts in favour of wishful thinking. 

So: 

How much do you *want* this deal to be realistic - to what degree are you telling yourself that the deal will happen?

Because we all tell ourselves fairy tales about the things we hope for in life - and your deals and your business don't get paid for fairy tales.

So if your reasoning is clear and logical, score as 5. But if your arguments are iffy and based on wishful thinking, it's a 1.

Our next question is:
