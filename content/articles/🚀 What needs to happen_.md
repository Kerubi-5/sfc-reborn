In order for this opportunity to turn into a sale, or for the deal to move forward:

Which action or event needs to take place?

Do you need to:

- Follow up?
- Reactivate a conversation that's gone quiet?
- Remind your buyer to send a Request For Proposal?
- Ask your attorney to draft up the NDA your client asked for?
- Record that bio video you said you'd send?

Whatever the type of deal or the stage it's in, there's always something that has to happen.

So once you determine what needs to happen, ask yourself:

That "thing" that needs to happen... **[[‚ùì Are you in control of the thing that needs to happen?|is it in your control?]]**
