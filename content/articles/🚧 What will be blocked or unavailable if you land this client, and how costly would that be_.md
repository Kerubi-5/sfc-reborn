Each time you say yes to something, you say no to other things.

This buyer you'd like to land, what resources would be unavailable while serving them?

What would be tied up, or unable to start, until the engagement ends?

If it's a lot, that means you score the deal a 1. If it's a little, it's 5.

That's the set of questions. Pick your next lead, [[🧹 Cull & Cleanup|and score him or her for the same questions. ]]

Done with all of them?

Then let's **[[🗑️ Do some math and get rid of the crud]]**.
