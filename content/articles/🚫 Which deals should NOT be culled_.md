> [[🔁 Workflows]] >> [[🧹 Cull & Cleanup]] >> Deals you must keep


Wait... shouldn't we look at the deals that *should* be culled, instead of the ones that shouldn't?

No, because that's how you bias the wrong way: you'll select a few that are obviously the wrong ones, and you'll still have a tonne that shouldn't be there.

Instead, select all the deals in your pipeline that are working, moving forward, and that absolutely should not be culled.

Tag them as 'keepers', and hide them from view.

Every single other deal is a candidate for deletion.

Pick one from the remaining deals, ask yourself the following questions, and assign a score of 1 through 5 for each question. 

(See [[Cull ranker table|here]] for a table to help you score them)
