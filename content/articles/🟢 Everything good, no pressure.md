> [[🔁 Workflows]] >> Business review

So you want to generate leads and opportunities, grow and scale, but you're not under pressure?

Then you get to play the long game.

It's a good position to be in, because you can operate in a precise, thoughtful, methodical way.

Meaning, you can work on opportunities that require more time to evolve, and probably more interactions with your buyer...

When such a deal closes, you're likely looking at a much higher payday than if you were in a rush, looking to close deals fast.

There are many different ways to develop big-ticket sales and much depends on your industry and your market.

As a simple and humble web app, I can't tell you all the ins, outs, the pros & cons...

But, I've been designed to ask strategic questions, and one of the best questions to ask when you're playing the long game, is:

**Should I focus on the [[👨‍🎓 SIBG Pt. 2.0 - The Grow Up Stage|"Grow Up"]] ingredients of my business, or instead on the [[👨‍🎓 SIBG Pt. 3.0 - The Scale Up Stage|"Scale Up"]] ingredients?**

Meaning:

At this stage, is your business best-served by consolidating what's working? (Grow Up)?

Or, are there systems and procedures in place, and we can handle increased sales and workload - are we ready to Scale Up?

These two stages are very distinct from each other, they both have their own ingredients - and it's important to make sure you use the right ingredients, in the right way.

For that, here is the mini-training **[[👨‍🎓 Mini-training - Introduction to Stages & Ingredients of Business Growth (SIBG) Pt. 0.0|Stages and Ingredients of Business Growth]]**.

<!--and "Three ways to grow a business" (Coming soon) should give you some ideas on where to focus.

No training needed, but you've got deals and you want to move them forward...?
