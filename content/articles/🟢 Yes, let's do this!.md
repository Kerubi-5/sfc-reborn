Awesome. Action stations! ðŸš€

Good luck, have fun, and remember:

If you focus on the right people (with the right problem, and the right urgency), you'll never be an annoying pest, but always a welcome guest.

Make sure you return tomorrow for another round of SalesFlow Coach and working on your pipeline and deals!

And if you need any help, Martin is only a message away - just [ping him here](mailto:personal@salesflowcoach.app).

Fun fact:

At this stage, with SFC in Beta mode, he's super keen on feedback, and he'll be more than happy to answer your question, as a way to thank you for being a beta-tester.
