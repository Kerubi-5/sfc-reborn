title: 🤩 What is something that always delights this person?

The best possible reaction you could trigger when contacting someone, is mix of surprise and delight.

Not that you need to blow them away or make them fall in love with you - any positive reaction, however small, is a win.

So you send a 1-liner to someone who likes to communicate like that, and not a 500-word missive.

You send a word of support to someone you know tends to struggle.

You dial a number, for someone who likes to talk and doesn't like screens.

You share a cool find, with someone who likes to keep an eye on trends.

Something small, something delightful.

Make a note of it, and then ask:
