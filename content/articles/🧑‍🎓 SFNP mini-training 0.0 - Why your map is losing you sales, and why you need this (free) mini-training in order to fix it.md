## Mini-training Sales For Nice People Pt 0.0: An introduction

The one thing you must do if you want to improve your sales, and the one thing that will give you the biggest chance of winning a deal:

Get better at creating 'maps'.

Because the quality, detail and resolution that you have of the 'map of your buyer', the more accurately you'll know how to communicate with them, and what to say in order to advance your deal.

Of course when Korzybski coined the statement 'The map is not the territtory', he was talking about how words (maps, or symbols) are not the same thing as the reality (the territory) that those words describe or represent, and back in 1933, I doubt he was thinking about how this applies to selling your work.

But it does, and in fact, you being able to create accurate 'maps' might just be the make-or-break skill that can turn your 2024 into a spectacular success.

Why?

Because a human being simply isn't able to perceive everything there is in reality. Even if we were able to collect all the data there is, on all the things there are, which we aren't, we still wouldn't be able to perceive everything there is, because there's just too goddam much of it. I mean, have you ever looked out at the night sky? Yeah, good luck trying to perceive everything.

Now human beings have a very handy skill that has enabled us to make our way through this enormously large world, despite the fact that we don't even know and perceive even a fraction of it:

We make maps. We make mental representations, we abstract away all kinds of detail, we mentally stylise things until there's a handy, portable proxy, of the thing we know or have perceived. Put differently, we use heuristics, and they're pretty helpful in keeping us advancing and surviving.

Heuristics are absolute murder for your sales though, because maps and heuristics automatically exclude details and information, and in many, many of the cases when you lose a deal, it's because there was a crucial bit of information that wasn't included in your map of the buyer.

That adwords client that's looking to hire you and has a $30.000 monthly advertising budget... where did they go? Everything was discussed and confirmed and agreed and you were going to get paid weeks ago... and now they'er not even replying? What the hell is that all about?

Well, maybe there was something you didn't know. Sure, maybe John there is super keen to get started, but he can't get the signoff from Finance, because it just so happens that the son of the Finance Director also works at the company, and thinks SEO is rubbish, because he wants to do content marketing campaigns, and he keeps talking his dad out of paying you.

Important data. Wasn't in your map. Oops.

This is why Sales For Nice People exists: to teach you how to have the kind of sales conversations that reveal the important bits of data, the details that you must know, in order to have a map of sufficient resolution.

That way you'll know what your buyer's world is like, you'll 'learn what it's like to be them', you'll know what their objections and challenges are, and you'll know what to say to them to make the deal move forward and turn into a contract.

For most sellers, their map is stupidly basic:

"Buyer has problem. Me got solution. You pay me, I go solve."

And yes, that map is accurate to a degree. But it's also caveman-like crude, and it is guaranteed to exclude data that could help you close the deal. So, don't be like a neanderthal, but instead

The map is not the territory. Create better maps.

And for that, tomorrow, we start with Chapter 1.0 of the free mini-training Sales for Nice People, where we start with the most important thing in selling - a synonym actually, in my opinion: Listening.
