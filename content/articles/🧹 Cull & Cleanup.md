> [[🔁 Workflows]] >> [[🧹 Cull & Cleanup]]

Cleaning up deadwood and getting rid of duds happens far too little.

Over time, no-chance deals and tire-kicker buyers accumulate, and you end up with a CRM full of crud.

There are two main reasons for a messy pipeline:

1. FOMO: you don't want to miss out on opportunities
2. BS-ing yourself: you tell yourself that this or that deal represents so much revenue in your projections for the future

But while you're busy trying to land a deal that just won't happen, you're unable to work on other deals, which could have a far bigger payday.

Here are some of the reasons why any particular deal might should be deleted from your pipeline:

- Scope creep
- Haggling
- Mismatch in values
- Sales cycle too long
- Boring industry
- Boring individual
- Client is a taker, not a giver or matcher (Google: Adam Grant, *Give & Take*)
- BS-ing yourself about the probability of a deal

So let's look at pipeline cleanup in a rational & measured way, so that we only throw away the chaff, and not the wheat.
